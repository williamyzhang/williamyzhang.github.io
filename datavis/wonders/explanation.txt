1. To draw the world map, we simply create an EqualEarth projection and add a sphere
and graticule first before plotting the countries as paths. I chose 15 degrees
as the interval for my graticules so that it would not be too crowded when displaying
the entire earth. 
2. The wonders are plotted as circles with their centers at the coordinate projection
of their lat/lon, and their radius a multiple of the number of visitors. A delay
transition is used to make sure the circles and the text appear in sequential order.
3. The opacity change is done via CSS interactivity, while the tooltip appears on
mouseover. Much of the appearance of the tooltip is done in CSS, while the content
is simply taken from symbolsData.
