1. For the map, I simply combined the sphere from 4.2 with the colourScale handling
from 4.1 to get a world map colored according to economy.
2. Since the legend interacts with the world map, I added it as part of 
choroplethMap.js, so that the interactivity code could incorporate both the country
paths and the legend elements. For the bounding box, I added a rectangle
before the legend elements whose height depends on the size of the scale domain.
3. The legend clicking interactivity is implemented with an on "click" function,
that selects all the countries whose fill color does not correspond to the clicked
legend item's color, and then checks whether those countries are attenuated or
fully visible and changes their color and the color of the other legend items
accordingly. Furthermore, a lastSelectedRegion variable is stored to ensure that
once the user clicks to highlight a region, they must click off of that region
before select to highlight another.
4. The tooltip is implemented similarly to 4.1, with an added if statement to
make sure the country is fully visible before displaying the tooltip.
