1. The map is rendered by choroplethMap by defining the projection and pathGenerator
used, then calling d3-zoom to allow zoom interactivity, calling projection.fitSize()
to fit the map to our screen size, and finally appending paths for each country,
to which we add a colour fill based on population density by passing it to 
colourScale.
2. The hovering requirements are implemented partially by CSS, which thickens the
outline around countries you hover over. The tooltip is implemented by event listeners
in choroplethMap, which retrieve data from the path element to display in a formatted
HTML tooltip.
