1. My solution represents the x-axis and y-axis labels as their own variables,
which are modified each time the user makes a selection. The visualisation updates
as well once one variable changes, thus being consistent with the unidirectional
flow pattern. The options of labels to select from are simply a hardcoded
constant array of the numerical data columns, since the data being loaded in
also hardcodes the columns.
2. To highlight circles on cursor hovering, I simply used CSS interactivity with
circles:hover for simplicity. For the labels, I used the other CSS trick of having
a title that appears with the necessary information when the cursor hovers over
the circles. These are simple and maintain the unidirectional flow pattern.
